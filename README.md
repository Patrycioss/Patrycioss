# Hello there! 👋

My name is Patrick and I'm an aspiring game programmer excited for programming games. I have always had interest in games 🎮 and the past few years I have garnered more and more interest in the technical stuff ⚙️ behind them.
Right now I'm studying at University of Applied Sciences Saxion to expand this interest into knowledge. 📚
